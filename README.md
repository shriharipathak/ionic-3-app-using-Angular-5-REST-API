Create ionic 3 app using Angular5 and REST API

I have created this just for learning the basics of Angular5 and ionic. In case you wanted to use this, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Node latest version. Just download the package manager for your OS and install.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once installed you can run "npm node -v" to check teh version of it. When I installed this was 5.6.0

2. Once Node installed you can go for install ionic. Below link will help you in this.
https://ionicframework.com/getting-started

3. Hurry 0.5! You have Node and ionic installed on your machine.

4. Now let's start our ionic project.
on terminal: "ionic start FirstApp" and hit return. 
This will create folder named "FirstAPP" and will add required Node modules inside. SRC is the folder which should be your main concern.

5. Now download this repo and replace with your SRC folder.

6. Hurrey 1.0!! you (should) have a running List/Add app on ionic3/ Angular5 using REST APIs.
